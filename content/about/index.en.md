## Holzwege

*Holzwege* is a collection texts by Martin Heidegger. Translated as *Off the Beaten Track*. Is where he discussed questions about art, history and existence. Once I had a chance to read one of its texts, *The Origin of the Work of Art*, I found the ideas are so delectable. Using this name as the title of the website is to wish I can explore just like in the holzwege, sort out the path of my thoughts.
